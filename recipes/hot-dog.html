    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
        <li>Combine ground beef, water, 1/2 cup diced onion, ketchup, butter, garlic, chili powder, salt, black pepper, cumin, celery salt, and cayenne pepper together in a pot. Mix with a potato masher or spatula over medium-high heat until mixture has a finely ground consistency and begins to bubble, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring beef mixture to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens and reduces, about 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook hot dogs in boiling water until heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange hot dog buns on a baking sheet. Cook buns in the preheated oven until soft and warm, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place 1 bun on a plate. Place a hot dog in the bun and top with meat sauce. Drizzle yellow mustard and a portion of remaining diced onion over the meat sauce. Repeat with remaining hot dogs.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your meal!</li>
